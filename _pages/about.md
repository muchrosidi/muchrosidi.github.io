I am currently pursuing a [Ph.D. at the Martin School of Public Policy and Administration](https://martin.uky.edu/academic-programs/phd), [University of Kentucky](https://www.uky.edu/). My research utilizes causal inference and other quantitative methodologies to evaluate the effects of government policies, with specific interests in public finance, public financial management, and the economics of education. I aim to generate evidence-based insights that inform policy decisions.

Before embarking on my doctoral journey, I gained valuable experience through various professional roles within the [Indonesia Ministry of Finance](https://web.kemenkeu.go.id/en), where I developed a deep understanding of the inner workings of government policies. I have gained expertise in formulating laws and regulations, particularly in understanding how policies are translated into regulations within the Indonesian context. My focus extends to various aspects of fiscal policy, although my knowledge is not limited solely to this area. Additionally, I served as a guest lecturer at my undergraduate alma mater.

I hold a [Master of Arts (M.A.) degree in Applied Economics](https://lsa.umich.edu/econ/mae.html) from [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/) and obtained a Bachelor of Applied Science (B.App.Sc.) in Accounting from Sekolah Tinggi Akuntansi Negara<sup>1</sup> in Jakarta.
