## Course 1: [Introduction to Difference-in-Differences with Variation in Treatment Timing](link-to-course-1)
In Fall 2023, I was invited as a guest lecturer for a PhD-level research methods course at the Department of Accounting, Faculty of Economics and Business, Universitas Indonesia where I conducted a session on "Introduction to Difference-in-Differences with Variation in Treatment Timing." This lecture was also attended by several faculty members.

The course material encompassed four key segments: canonical DID, DID with variations in treatment timing, recent developments in DID considering treatment timing variations, and a practical STATA simulation. During the STATA simulation, participants were guided through the estimation process utilizing three distinct estimators: two-way fixed effects, Callaway & Santanna (2021), and de Chaisemartin & D’Haultfoeuille (2022). The simulation session aimed to replicate a work presented by de Chaisemartin & D’Haultfoeuille (2023) in their paper titled Two-way fixed effects and differences-in-differences with heterogeneous treatment effects: a survey.
