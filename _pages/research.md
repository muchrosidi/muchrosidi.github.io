#### **Working Papers**:

#### Forgiving as a Revenue Booster? Evidence from Repeating Vehicle Tax Amnesties in Indonesia

Abstract:  I examine vehicle tax amnesty programs in Indonesia that have been very popular in dealing
with high delinquency rates. From 2008 to 2020, provincial amnesties occurred every 2.5 years on
average. Using the variation in the timing of the province’s amnesty adoptions, I estimate the effect
of vehicle tax amnesty on vehicle tax revenue using difference-in-differences. The short-run increase
in vehicle tax revenue due to vehicle tax amnesty ranges from 2.5 to 3.7 percent in my preferred
specification. When considering the reduction in tax penalties, the impact diminishes by about half,
and in some cases, the results do not exhibit statistical significance or show only marginal significance.
Using an event-study design, I do not find the effect of vehicle tax amnesty on provincial revenue during
the three years following adoption. The initial result confirms why amnesties have been highly popular.
Moreover, the substantial reduction in estimated impacts when factoring in tax penalties suggests that
vehicle tax amnesty might not be a suitable choice for revenue increase, especially in light of scholars’
concerns about its potential negative impact on future compliance. Without addressing the root
causes of delinquency, the direct election system of governors may still encourage local leaders to adopt
populist policies to win favor and votes. If that is the case, the widespread adoption of vehicle tax
amnesty will likely remain a common practice.
